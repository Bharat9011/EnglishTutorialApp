            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Wh-questions are questions that begin with words like <strong>who</strong>, <strong>what</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, <strong>where</strong>, <strong>why</strong>, <strong>how</strong>, and <strong>which</strong>. These questions are used to gather specific information. A negative Wh-question is simply a Wh-question with a negation added. This is typically formed by adding <strong>"not"</strong> after the auxiliary verb (like do, did, is, are, etc.).</p>

            <h2>Structure of Negative Wh-Questions</h2>
            <p>The structure of a negative Wh-question depends on the type of Wh-word used and the tense of the sentence. Hereâ€™s the basic structure:</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Wh-word + auxiliary verb + subject + not + main verb</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> What don't you like?</li>
                <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Why hasn't she arrived yet?</li>
                <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> When didn't they call me?</li>
