      <h4>1. Be-form</h4>
      <p>In this section, you will learn about the basic forms of the verb 'to be' (am, is, are). These forms are essential for forming sentences about the present, describing people, places, and things, and talking about your feelings.</p>
      <h6>Examples:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>I am a student.</li>
        <li>She is happy.</li>
        <li>They are friends.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>2. WH-questions</h4>
      <p>WH-questions are used to ask for specific information. They begin with words like who, what, where, when, why, and how.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is your teacher?</li>
        <li>What is your name?</li>
        <li>Where do you live?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>3. Tense</h4>
